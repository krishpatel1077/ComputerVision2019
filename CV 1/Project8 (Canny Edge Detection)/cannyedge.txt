1)input image as ppm
2)Apply Gaussian filter on ppm
3)Find intensity gradients of image
4)Apply non-maximum suppression to
get rid of suprious edge detection
5)Apply double treshold to determine
potential edges
6)Track edge by hysterisis:
remove all the other edges that
are weak and not connected to
strong edges.
